# Duplicate Header Fix Summary

## Issue Description
All specialized deal pages had **duplicate HTML headers** - they had their own complete `<!DOCTYPE html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>` sections, AND they were also including `includes/header.php`, which created a second complete HTML document structure.

This caused:
- Invalid HTML (nested `<!DOCTYPE html>` declarations)
- Duplicate navigation bars
- Potential browser rendering issues
- SEO problems (duplicate title/meta tags)

## Root Cause
The pages were auto-generated with a complete HTML structure embedded, but they also called `include 'includes/header.php';` which itself contains a complete HTML header with navigation.

## Solution Applied
Removed the duplicate HTML structure (`<!DOCTYPE html>` through `<body>` tag) from all pages and replaced it with:
1. Setting page variables (`$pageTitle`, `$pageDescription`, `$pageKeywords`)
2. Including the standard header (`include 'includes/header.php';`)
3. Moving custom `<style>` blocks after the include

## Fix Pattern

### Before (Incorrect):
```php
$pageTitle = "Page Title";
$metaDescription = "Description";
?>
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title><?php echo $pageTitle; ?></title>
    <meta name="description" content="<?php echo $metaDescription; ?>">
    <meta name="keywords" content="keywords here">
    <link href="..." rel="stylesheet">
    <style>
        /* Custom styles */
    </style>
</head>
<body>
    <?php include 'includes/header.php'; ?>  <!-- DUPLICATE! -->
```

### After (Correct):
```php
$pageTitle = "Page Title";
$pageDescription = "Description";
$pageKeywords = "keywords here";

// Include header
include 'includes/header.php';
?>

<style>
    /* Custom styles */
</style>
```

# üîß Product URL Fix Summary

## Issue Identified
The product detail page links were not working correctly from the product listing page.

## Root Cause
- **URL Structure Mismatch**: The generated URLs didn't match the .htaccess rewrite rules
- **Configuration Conflict**: SITE_URL was set to `https://www.thiyagideals.com` but URLs were being generated with `/shop/` prefix

## ‚úÖ Fixes Applied

### 1. **Corrected Product URL Generation**
**File:** `index.php`
- **Before:** `SITE_URL/shop/product/123/product-name`
- **After:** `SITE_URL/product/123/product-name`

### 2. **Updated AJAX Load More URLs**
**File:** `ajax/load_more_products.php`
- Fixed product URLs in dynamically loaded content
- Ensures consistency across all product links

### 3. **Optimized .htaccess Rules**
**File:** `.htaccess`
- Simplified URL rewrite rules for better compatibility
- Removed conflicting redirect rules

### 4. **Added URL Fallback Mechanism**
**File:** `index.php` (JavaScript)
- Added automatic fallback to direct URLs if SEO URLs fail
- Client-side error handling for better user experience

### 5. **Created Debug Tools**
**Files:** `url-test.php`, `test-urls.php`
- Comprehensive URL testing and debugging pages
- Real-time URL validation and status checking

## üéØ URL Structure Now Working

### SEO-Friendly URLs (Primary)
```
https://www.thiyagideals.com/product/123/product-name-slug
https://www.thiyagideals.com/product/123/
```

## 💡 Technical Notes

### Why 200px Height?
- Optimal for product cards in 4-column layout
- Provides good aspect ratio for most product images
- Prevents excessive scrolling on mobile
- Consistent with modern e-commerce standards
- Can be adjusted per category if needed

### Why object-fit: cover?
- Maintains aspect ratio
- Fills entire container
- No distortion or stretching
- Better than "contain" (no white space)
- Industry standard for product images

### Why overflow: hidden?
- Prevents image spillage
- Creates clean boundaries
- Works with border-radius
- Essential for fixed-height containers
- Performance benefit (no overflow calculations)

## 🐛 Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: Images Still Overlapping
**Solution:**
1. Clear browser cache (Ctrl + Shift + Delete)
2. Hard refresh (Ctrl + F5)
3. Check if CSS loaded (F12 → Elements → .product-image)
4. Verify `overflow: hidden` and `height: 200px` present

### Issue 2: Images Look Stretched
**Solution:**
- Check for `object-fit: cover` on `.product-image img`
- Ensure image aspect ratio is reasonable
- Verify image source URLs are valid

### Issue 3: Gaps Between Image and Title
**Solution:**
- Check `.product-info` has `margin-top: 0`
- Verify no additional spacing CSS
- Check for conflicting Bootstrap classes

### Issue 4: Mobile View Broken
**Solution:**
- Verify Bootstrap grid: `col-6 col-md-4 col-lg-3`
- Check media queries still active
- Test on actual device (not just browser resize)

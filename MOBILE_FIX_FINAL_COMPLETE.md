## 🔍 Second Review Findings (CRITICAL!)

###  **Major Discovery: 52 Additional Pages Were Missing!**

During the second comprehensive review, I discovered **52 more deal pages** that had product links but were missing the `data-product-id` attribute. These pages used different button classes (`btn btn-primary` instead of `view-details-btn`), which is why they were missed in the first review.
